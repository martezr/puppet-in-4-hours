# Lab #2: Installing Puppet Server

## Overview
In this lab you will walk through the process of setting up the Puppet primary server component in the Puppet architecture. You will install the Puppet server, PuppetDB and PostgreSQL components on the same virtual machine that acts as the server node.

## Exercises

[Lab 2.2: Install PostgreSQL](#lab-22-install-postgresql)

[Lab 2.4: Configure Puppet Server to PuppetDB connection](#lab-24-configure-puppet-server-to-puppetdb-connection)

### Lab 2.1: Install Puppet Server

This lab walks through installing the Puppet Server package on the server node.

1. Download the Puppet repository package

```bash
wget https://apt.puppet.com/puppet7-release-focal.deb
```

2. Install the Puppet repository on the system

```bash
sudo dpkg -i puppet7-release-focal.deb
```

3. Trigger an apt update to enable the Puppet repository

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
```

4. Install the puppetserver package on the system

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y puppetserver
```

5. Start the puppetserver service

```bash
sudo systemctl start puppetserver
```

6. Enable the puppetserver service to start on boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable puppetserver
```

### Lab 2.2: Install PostgreSQL

This lab walks through install and configuring the PostgreSQL database used by PuppetDB.

1. Install PostgreSQL

```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

2. 

```bash
sudo su postgres <<EOF
createdb -E UTF8 -O postgres puppetdb;
psql -c "CREATE USER puppetdb WITH PASSWORD 'password123';"
psql -c "CREATE USER puppetdb_read WITH PASSWORD 'password123';"
psql puppetdb -c 'revoke create on schema public from public'
psql puppetdb -c 'grant create on schema public to puppetdb'
psql puppetdb -c 'alter default privileges for user puppetdb in schema public grant select on tables to puppetdb_read'
psql puppetdb -c 'alter default privileges for user puppetdb in schema public grant usage on sequences to puppetdb_read'
psql puppetdb -c 'alter default privileges for user puppetdb in schema public grant execute on functions to puppetdb_read'
psql puppetdb -c 'create extension pg_trgm'
EOF
```

3. 

```bash
/etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
```

### Lab 2.3: Install and Configure PuppetDB

This lab walks through installing PuppetDB and connecting it to the PostgreSQL database.

1. Install PuppetDB

```bash
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource package puppetdb ensure=latest
```

2. Configure the PuppetDB database connection details

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/conf.d/database.ini
[database]

# The database address, i.e. //HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
subname = //localhost:5432/puppetdb

# Connect as a specific user
username = puppetdb

# Use a specific password
password = password123

# How often (in minutes) to compact the database
# gc-interval = 60
EOF
```

3. Start the PuppetDB service and enable it to start on boot

```bash
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppetdb ensure=running enable=true
```

# Lab 2.4: Configure Puppet Server to PuppetDB Connection

1. Install plugins

```bash
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource package puppetdb-termini ensure=latest
```

2. 

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppetdb.conf
[main]
server_urls = https://puppet:8081
EOF
```

3. 

```bash
cat << EOF >> /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
reports = puppetdb
storeconfigs_backend = puppetdb
storeconfigs = true
EOF
```

4. 

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/routes.yaml
---
primary server:
  facts:
    terminus: puppetdb
    cache: yaml
EOF
```

5. Update the file permissions on all files in the Puppet configuration directory

```bash
sudo chown -R puppet:puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
```

6. Restart the Puppet Server service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart puppetserver
```
