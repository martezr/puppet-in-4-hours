This repository hosts the code and examples for the Puppet in 4 hours online workshop.

## Getting Started

Download the Github repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:martezr/puppet-in-4-hours.git
```

Change the current working directory to the Github repository

```bash

The lab exercises use two Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machines that run locally using HashiCorp Vagrant. Run the `vagrant up` command to provision the virtual machines on the local machine. If you don't have Vagrant installed then it can be installed using the following documentation - https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vagrant/getting-started-install.

```bash
vagrant up
```

```bash
vagrant ssh server
```

```bash
vagrant ssh agent
```
